-- Best-effort restore sketch for the tenancy strip (ADR-0029). This is a breaking module
-- release against dev-stage databases: the down re-adds the company_id column as nullable
-- with its plain index and the company isolation policy shape, but restores NO data —
-- rows written after the strip (or after the decorator re-keyed them) carry org_unit_id
-- only. The composing service's tenancy decorator remains the live fence; treat this
-- down as a schema-shape sketch for archaeology, not a usable rollback.
